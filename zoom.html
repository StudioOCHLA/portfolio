                        <h2>Work-from-home user</h2>
                        <p>
                            During quarantine, people are looking for ways to effectively interact virtually and
                            adapt to work-from-home lifestyles. They are becoming reliant on video chatting
                            platforms, such as Zoom, to communicate and run their businesses. With changing user
                            habits, how can we improve this product to make the work-from-home experience easier and
                            more efficient?
                            <br><br>Three design concepts were created for an improved user interface, particularly
                            regarding screen sharing. The project
                            was part of a university interaction design course i stood for all the work.

                            The goal is to improve the user interface, particularly in relation to screen sharing.
                            <br><br>
                            I have developed three new, different, and unique user interface suggestions for the
                            artefact based on the
                            user's context and use. The design of each interface proposal has been based on
                            different design principles, as per
                            Donald Norman (2013: The Design of Everyday Things).

                            CHANGE TO MY TEXT. The in-call meetings feature helps users quickly navigate between
                            meetings and access
                            their schedules and information while in ongoing calls. Information and actions are
                            consolidated into a concise and accessible window to make the process of organizing and
                            attending virtual meetings simpler and faster.

                            This design proposal makes it easy to comprehend all possible actions through perceived
                            affordances and
                            descriptive signifiers. <br><br>
                            In my view, these signifiers drive the primary goal of the interface proposal, which is to
                            improve its discoverability. The center object is highlighted and explained, and it is
                            clearly configured.
